# Blinkit-Sales-analysis
An end-to-end Business Intelligence project focused on analyzing sales performance data from Blinkit – India’s last-minute delivery app. Built using Power BI, SQL, and Python, this project delivers actionable insights on outlet performance, item-level sales, and customer behavior.

## 🧠 Project Objective
- To build an interactive dashboard that empowers business stakeholders to:
- Monitor Total Sales, Average Sales, and Item Ratings.
- Analyze performance across Outlet Types, Item Categories, Fat Content, and Locations.
- Identify top-selling products and underperforming areas to drive informed decision-making.

## ✨ Project Highlights
- 📦 Analyzed over 8,500+ unique products across multiple outlet types and sizes to uncover category-level trends and customer preferences.
- 💰 Tracked and visualized $1.20M+ in total sales, with metrics on average sales ($141) and average rating (3.9).
- 🏪 Identified high-performing outlet types (e.g., Supermarket Type 1 contributing 65%+ of total revenue) and top-performing outlet tiers and sizes.

## 📌 Features
- Dynamic and interactive filters for outlet type, size, location, and item categories.
- Visual segmentation of sales by fat content and item popularity.
- Historical performance trends and rating-based comparison.
- Clean and professional UI suitable for business presentations.

## 🔧 Process Overview
**1. Data Collection & Understanding**
- Sourced Blinkit’s item-level sales dataset containing outlet info, item metadata, and sales metrics.
- Defined business questions to guide dashboard logic and visualizations.
  
**2. Data Cleaning & Preparation**
- Cleaned raw data using SQL queries to handle missing values, duplicates, and formatting inconsistencies.
- Used Python for additional preprocessing and statistical exploration.
  
**3. Data Modeling**
- Imported data into Power BI and created a robust data model using:
- Fact and dimension tables
- Relationships between outlet, item, and sales data
- DAX measures for KPIs (e.g., Total Sales, Avg Rating)

**4. Dashboard Development**
- Built a highly visual, interactive dashboard using:
- Cards for KPIs
- Bar/column charts for outlet/item performance
- Line charts for historical sales trends
- Donut and pie charts for fat content and outlet segmentation
- Slicers for dynamic filtering by outlet type, size, and item type

## 📊 SQL
- 🗃️ Utilized SQL for data extraction, cleaning and transformation, enabling clean modeling and deeper querying into outlet and item-level sales behavior.
- Wrote queries to find KPI values and other business requirements.

## 📊 Python
- 🧹 Imported, cleaned and preprocessed data using Python (Pandas, NumPy) to ensure quality inputs.
- Wrote scripts to get output based on the chart requirements and KPIs.
- Built various charts using Matplotlib.

## 📈 Key Insights
- 💰 $1.20M+ in total sales recorded across all outlet types.
- 🛍️ 8523 items sold, with high-performing categories like snacks, dairy, and drinks.
